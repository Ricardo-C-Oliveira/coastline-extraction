# coastline-extraction
Methods to identify and extract coastline from remote sensed data.

This projects uses K-Means and AgglomerativeClustering algorithms provided by SciPy to perform unsupervised classification on NDWI images. There is also a function to calculate NDWI from Landsat8 bands 5 and 3. Finally, there is a function that performs contour extraction using the marching squares algorithm provided by Skimage.
